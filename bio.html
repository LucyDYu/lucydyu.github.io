      My research generally focuses on developing machine learning algorithms applied to graph-structured data.
      I have worked on developing generalized graph neural networks that are scalable to web-scale datasets, with applications in recommender systems, NLP and IR system.
      I'm also interested in deep generative models for graphs and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning.

      Prior to my PhD, I obtained my M.S. (Computer Science) and B.E. (Electronics Engineering) from the Australia National University and ZhengZhou University, respectively.
      I have also worked as Senior R&D Engineer at Alibaba Group and JD.com.
